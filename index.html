    <h2>Quick Review on What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Research has shown that some talented young programmers who started coding on their own<br>
      give up coding because they didn't get to form a strong bond with coding and then they<br>
      get frustrated and the reason is because they lack good team work. They didn't get to<br>
      know people that have interest in whta they do, that is why they gave up.<br>
      and that is why Let's Code It is here to bring young developers from all areas<br>
      together so that they can work on projects together, learn together and get jobs together.<br>
      So if you are a young developer, here is your home and if you are a pro here is also your<br>
      home.
      Let's sit our ass down and build some record breaking apps<br>
